# Vehicle-Detection
Vehicle detection using pre-trained Haar Cascade

Using a pre-trained Haar Cascade for vehicle detection, the system is able to track individual vehicles given any video input. 
Certain attributes were also derived from individual vehicles once detected, in particular, vehicle color. 
Furthermore, our system is also able to keep track of the total number of vehicles present in the environment.
